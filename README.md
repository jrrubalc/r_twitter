# r_twitter
This script utilizes the Twitter public API to collect data and save it on a CSV file. 
It runs through a list of search phrases, queries.txt, which can be modified based on the users desired interests. 
The language and sentiment is classified. Everything is saved to a CSV and the program ends.


Be sure to change ‘queries.txt’ with your own search phrases and credentialEXAMPLE.r with your own API credentials.
